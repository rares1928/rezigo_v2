1. Hash those passwords

2. Allow for third-party identity providers if possible

7. Validate the user's identity

8. Allow users to change their username

9. Let your users delete their accounts

13. Build a secure auth system
If you're using a service like Identity Platform, 
a lot of security concerns are handled for you automatically. 
However, your service will always need to be engineered properly to prevent abuse. 
Core considerations include implementing a password reset instead of password retrieval,
detailed account activity logging, rate-limiting login attempts to prevent credential stuffing,
locking out accounts after too many unsuccessful login attempts, 
and requiring two-factor authentication for unrecognized devices or accounts that have been idle for extended periods. 
There are many more aspects to a secure authentication system, so please see the further reading 
section below for links to more information.
